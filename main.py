##Debugging challenge:
# Try running this code and type 5.
# It will give you an IndexError and point to line 32 as the issue.
# But on line 38 we are trying to prevent a crash by detecting
# any numbers great than or equal to 3 or less than 0.
# So what's going on?
# Can you debug the code and fix it?
# Solution:
